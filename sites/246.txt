    Best practices for web apps
  



Developing web pages and web applications for mobile devices presents a different set of
challenges compared to developing a web page for the typical
desktop web browser. Refer to the following related resources:

Pixel-Perfect UI in the WebView
Creating
  a Mobile-First Responsive Web Design
High
  DPI Images for Variable Pixel Densities

To help you get started, the following is a list of practices you should
follow in order to provide the most effective web application for Android and other mobile
devices.

Redirect mobile devices to a dedicated mobile version of your website
  There are several ways you can redirect requests to the mobile version of your website, using
server-side redirects. Most often, this is done by "sniffing" the User Agent
string provided by the web browser. To determine whether to serve a mobile version of your site, you
should look for the "mobile" string in the User Agent.
Note: Large screen Android-powered devices that should be served
full-size websites (such as tablets) do not include the "mobile" string in the User Agent,
while the rest of the User Agent string is mostly the same. As such, it's important that you deliver
the mobile version of your website based on whether the "mobile" string exists in the User
Agent.
Use HTML5 DOCTYPE for mobile devices
  The most common markup language used for mobile websites
  is 
  HTML5. This standard encourages mobile-first development to ensure that websites work
  well on a variety of devices. Unlike previous web languages, HTML5 requires simpler
  <DOCTYPE> and charset declarations:
  

<!DOCTYPE html>
...
<meta charset="UTF-8">


Use viewport metadata to properly resize your web page
  In your document <head>, you should provide metadata that specifies how you
want the browser's viewport to render your web page. For example, your viewport metadata can
specify the height and width for the browser's viewport, the initial web page scale, and even the
target screen density.
For example:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no">

For more information about how to use viewport metadata for Android-powered devices, read Targeting Screens from Web Apps.

Use a vertical linear layout
  Avoid the need for the user to scroll left and right while navigating your web
page. Scrolling up and down is easier for the user and makes your web page simpler.

Set the layout height and width to match_parent
Setting your WebView
object's height and width to match_parent ensures that your app's views
are sized correctly. We discourage setting the height to wrap_content because
it results in incorrect sizing and, in apps targeting Android 4.4 (API level 19) and
lower, the HTML viewport meta tags are ignored to preserve
backwards compatibility. Similarly, setting the layout width to wrap_content is not
supported and causes your WebView to use the width of its parent instead.
Because of this behavior, it is also important to make sure that none of your WebView
object's parent layout objects have their
height and width set to wrap_content. 
Avoid multiple file requests
Because mobile devices typically have a connection speed far
slower than a desktop computer, you should make your web pages load as fast as possible. One way to
speed it up is to avoid loading extra files such as stylesheets and script files in the
<head>. A better way that you can optimize page loading on mobile devices is by
performing mobile analysis with
Google’s PageSpeed Insights. If you want to optimize your app’s performance, see PageSpeed Insights Rules.



For a more thorough guide on creating great mobile web applications, see the W3C's Mobile Web Best Practices.
For other guidance on improving the speed of your website (for mobile and desktop), see
Google's speed tutorials in
Make the Web Faster.
