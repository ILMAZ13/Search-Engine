    Handle Activity State Changes
  



Different events, some user-triggered and some system-triggered, can cause
an Activity to transition from one state to another. This
document describes some common cases in which such transitions happen, and
how to handle those transitions.


For more information about activity states, see

Understand the Activity Lifecycle. To learn about how
the ViewModel
class can help you manage the activity lifecycle,
see Understand the ViewModel Class.

Configuration change occurs

There are a number of events that can trigger a configuration change. Perhaps
the most prominent example is a change between portrait and landscape
orientations. Other cases that can cause configuration changes include changes
to language or input device.


When a configuration change occurs, the activity is destroyed and recreated.
The original activity instance will have the
onPause(),
onStop(), and
onDestroy() callbacks triggered. A new instance of the activity will be created and have the

onCreate(),
onStart(),
and onResume() callbacks triggered.


Use a combination of ViewModels, the onSaveInstanceState() method, and/or persistent local
storage to preserve an activity’s UI state across configuration changes.  Deciding how to combine
these options depends on the complexity of your UI data, use cases for your app, and
consideration of speed of retrieval versus memory usage. For more information on saving your
activity UI state, see Saving UI States.

Handling multi-window cases

When an app enters multi-window mode, available in Android 7.0
(API level 24)and higher, the system notifies the currently running activity of a
configuration change, thus going through the lifecycle transitions described
above. This behavior also occurs if an app already in multi-window mode
gets resized. Your activity can handle the configuration change itself,
or it can allow the system to destroy the activity and recreate it
with the new dimensions.


For more information about the multi-window lifecycle, see the Multi-Window Lifecycle section of the
Multi-Window Support
page.


In multi-window mode, although there are two apps that are visible to the
user, only the one with which the user is interacting is in the foreground
and has focus. That activity is in the Resumed state, while the app in the
other window is in the Paused state.


When the user switches from app A to app B, the system calls
onPause() on app A,
and onResume() on app B. It switches
between these two methods each time the user toggles between apps.


For more detail about multi-windowing, refer to
Multi-Window Support.

Activity or dialog appears in foreground

If a new activity or dialog appears in the foreground, taking focus and
partially covering the activity in progress, the covered activity loses focus
and enters the Paused state. Then, the system calls
onPause() on it.


When the covered activity returns to the foreground and regains focus, it
calls onResume().


If a new activity or dialog appears in the foreground, taking focus and
completely covering the activity in progress, the covered activity loses
focus and enters the Stopped state. The system then, in rapid succession,
calls onPause() and
onStop().


When the same instance of the covered activity comes back to the foreground,
the system calls onRestart(),
onStart(), and
onResume() on the activity.
If it is a new instance of the covered activity that comes to the
background, the system does not call onRestart(), only calling
onStart() and
onResume().


Note: When the user taps the Overview or Home button, the
system behaves as if the current activity has been completely covered.

User taps Back button 

If an activity is in the foreground, and the user taps the Back button,
the activity transitions through the
onPause(),
onStop(), and
onDestroy()
callbacks. In addition to being destroyed, the activity is also
removed from the back stack.


It is important to note that, by default, the
onSaveInstanceState()
callback does not fire in this case. This behavior is based on the assumption
that the user tapped the Back button with no expectation of returning to the
same instance of the activity. However, you can override the
onBackPressed() method
to implement some custom behavior, for example a "confirm-quit" dialog.


If you override the onBackPressed()
method, we still highly recommend that you invoke
super.onBackPressed() from your
overridden method. Otherwise the Back button behavior may be jarring to the
user.

System kills app process

If an app is in the background and the system needs to free up additional memory for a foreground
app, the background app can be killed by the system to free up more memory. To learn more about how
the system decides which processes to destroy, read

Activity state and ejection from memory and
Processes and Application Lifecycle.


To learn how to save your activity UI state when the system kills your app process, see
Saving and restoring activity state.
