    Animate drawable graphics
  




In some situations, images need to be animated on screen. This is useful if you want to display
a custom loading animation comprised of several images, or if you want one icon to morph into
another after a user's action. Android provides a couple options for animating drawables.


The first option is to use an Animation Drawable. This allows
you to specify several static drawable files
that will be displayed one at a time to create an
animation. The second option is to use an Animated Vector Drawable,
which lets you animate the properties of a
vector drawable.

Use AnimationDrawable

One way to animate Drawables is to load a series of
Drawable resources one after another to create an animation. This is a traditional animation in the
sense that it is created with a sequence of different images, played in order, like a roll of film.
The AnimationDrawable class is the basis for Drawable animations.

While you can define the frames of an animation in your code, using the AnimationDrawable class API, it's more simply accomplished with a
  single XML file that lists the frames that compose the animation. The XML file for this kind
  of animation belongs in the res/drawable/ directory of
  your Android project. In this case, the instructions are the order and duration for each frame of
  the animation.
The XML file consists of an <animation-list> element as the root node and a
  series of child <item> nodes that each define a frame: a drawable resource for
  the frame and the frame duration. Here's an example XML file for a Drawable animation:

<animation-list xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:oneshot="true">
    <item android:drawable="@drawable/rocket_thrust1" android:duration="200" />
    <item android:drawable="@drawable/rocket_thrust2" android:duration="200" />
    <item android:drawable="@drawable/rocket_thrust3" android:duration="200" />
</animation-list>

This animation runs for just three frames. By setting the android:oneshot
  attribute of the list to true, it will cycle just once then stop and hold on the last
  frame. If it is set false then the animation will loop. With this XML saved as
  rocket_thrust.xml in the res/drawable/ directory of the project, it can
  be added as the background image to a View and then called to play. Here's an example Activity,
  in which the animation is added to an ImageView and then animated when the
  screen is touched:
Kotlin

private lateinit var rocketAnimation: AnimationDrawable

override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    setContentView(R.layout.main)

    val rocketImage = findViewById<ImageView>(R.id.rocket_image).apply {
        setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.rocket_thrust)
        rocketAnimation = background as AnimationDrawable
    }

    rocketImage.setOnClickListener({ rocketAnimation.start() })
}

Java

AnimationDrawable rocketAnimation;

public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
  super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
  setContentView(R.layout.main);

  ImageView rocketImage = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.rocket_image);
  rocketImage.setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.rocket_thrust);
  rocketAnimation = (AnimationDrawable) rocketImage.getBackground();

  rocketImage.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
      @Override
      public void onClick(View view) {
        rocketAnimation.start();
      }
  });
}



It's important to note that the start() method called on the
AnimationDrawable
cannot be called during the onCreate() method of your Activity, because the
AnimationDrawable is not yet fully attached to the window. If you
want to play the animation
immediately, without requiring interaction, then you might want to call it from the
onStart()
method in your Activity, which will get called when Android makes the view visible on screen.


For more information on the XML syntax, available tags and attributes, see Animation Resources.

Use AnimatedVectorDrawable
A vector drawable
is a type of drawable that is scalable without getting pixelated or blurry. The
AnimatedVectorDrawable
class (and 
AnimatedVectorDrawableCompat for backward-compatibility) lets you animate the
properties of a vector drawable, such as rotating it or changing the path data to morph it into a
different image.


You normally define animated vector drawables in three XML files:


A vector drawable with the <vector> element in
res/drawable/
An animated vector drawable with the <animated-vector> element in
res/drawable/
One or more object animators with the <objectAnimator> element in
res/animator/


Animated vector drawables can animate the attributes of the <group> and
<path> elements. The <group> elements defines a set of
paths or subgroups, and the <path> element defines paths to be drawn.


When you define a vector drawable that you want to animate, use the android:name
attribute to assign a unique name to groups and paths, so you can refer to them from your animator
definitions. For example:


<!-- res/drawable/vectordrawable.xml -->
<vector xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:height="64dp"
    android:width="64dp"
    android:viewportHeight="600"
    android:viewportWidth="600">
    <group
        android:name="rotationGroup"
        android:pivotX="300.0"
        android:pivotY="300.0"
        android:rotation="45.0" >
        <path
            android:name="v"
            android:fillColor="#000000"
            android:pathData="M300,70 l 0,-70 70,70 0,0 -70,70z" />
    </group>
</vector>


The animated vector drawable definition refers to the groups and paths in the vector drawable
by their names:


<!-- res/drawable/animvectordrawable.xml -->
<animated-vector xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  android:drawable="@drawable/vectordrawable" >
    <target
        android:name="rotationGroup"
        android:animation="@anim/rotation" />
    <target
        android:name="v"
        android:animation="@anim/path_morph" />
</animated-vector>


The animation definitions represent ObjectAnimator or
AnimatorSet objects. The first animator in this example rotates the target
group 360 degrees:


<!-- res/animator/rotation.xml -->
<objectAnimator
    android:duration="6000"
    android:propertyName="rotation"
    android:valueFrom="0"
    android:valueTo="360" />


The second animator in this example morphs the vector drawable's path from one shape to
another. Both paths must be compatible for morphing: they must have the same number of commands
and the same number of parameters for each command.


<!-- res/animator/path_morph.xml -->
<set xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <objectAnimator
        android:duration="3000"
        android:propertyName="pathData"
        android:valueFrom="M300,70 l 0,-70 70,70 0,0   -70,70z"
        android:valueTo="M300,70 l 0,-70 70,0  0,140 -70,0 z"
        android:valueType="pathType" />
</set>


Here is the resulting AnimatedVectorDrawable:
