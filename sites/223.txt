    RenderScript Runtime API Reference
  



Overview
 RenderScript is a high-performance runtime that provides compute operations at the native level.
RenderScript code is compiled on devices at runtime to allow platform-independence as well.

 This reference documentation describes the RenderScript runtime APIs, which you can utilize
to write RenderScript code in C99. The RenderScript compute header files are automatically
included for you.

 To use RenderScript, you need to utilize the RenderScript runtime APIs documented here as well
as the Android framework APIs for RenderScript.  For documentation on the Android framework
APIs, see the android.renderscript package reference.

 For more information on how to develop with RenderScript and how the runtime and Android
framework APIs interact, see the RenderScript developer guide and the RenderScript samples.

Numerical Types
 Scalars:
 RenderScript supports the following scalar numerical types:

  8 bits         16 bits          32 bits        64 bits
Integer:          char, int8_t  short, int16_t  int32_t  long, long long, int64_t
Unsigned integer: uchar, uint8_t ushort, uint16_t uint, uint32_t ulong, uint64_t
Floating point:     half             float          double

 Vectors:
 RenderScript supports fixed size vectors of length 2, 3, and 4.
Vectors are declared using the common type name followed by a 2, 3, or 4.
E.g. float4, int3, double2, ulong4.

 To create vector literals, use the vector type followed by the values enclosed
between curly braces, e.g. (float3){1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f}.

 Entries of a vector can be accessed using different naming styles.

 Single entries can be accessed by following the variable name with a dot and:
The letters x, y, z, and w,
The letters r, g, b, and a,
The letter s or S, followed by a zero based index.
 For example, with int4 myVar; the following are equivalent:
  myVar.x == myVar.r == myVar.s0 == myVar.S0
  myVar.y == myVar.g == myVar.s1 == myVar.S1
  myVar.z == myVar.b == myVar.s2 == myVar.S2
  myVar.w == myVar.a == myVar.s3 == myVar.S3

 Multiple entries of a vector can be accessed at once by using an identifier that is
the concatenation of multiple letters or indices.  The resulting vector has a size
equal to the number of entries named.

 With the example above, the middle two entries can be accessed using
myVar.yz, myVar.gb, myVar.s12, and myVar.S12.

 The entries don't have to be contiguous or in increasing order.  Entries can even be
repeated, as long as we're not trying to assign to it.  You also can't mix the naming
styles.

 Here are examples of what can or can't be done:
float4 v4;
float3 v3;
float2 v2;
v2 = v4.xx; // Valid
v3 = v4.zxw; // Valid
v3 = v4.bba; // Valid
v3 = v4.s032; // Valid
v3.s120 = v4.S233; // Valid
v4.yz = v3.rg; // Valid
v4.yzx = v3.rg; // Invalid: mismatched sizes
v4.yzz = v3; // Invalid: z appears twice in an assignment
v3 = v3.xas0; // Invalid: can't mix xyzw with rgba nor s0...
v3 = v4.s034; // Invalid: the digit can only be 0, 1, 2, or 3


 Matrices and Quaternions:
 RenderScript supports fixed size square matrices of floats of size 2x2, 3x3, and 4x4.
The types are named rs_matrix2x2, rs_matrix3x3, and rs_matrix4x4.  See
Matrix Functions for the list of operations.

 Quaternions are also supported via rs_quaternion.  See Quaterion Functions for the list
of operations.

rs_yuv_format


      YUV format
    


Conversion Functions
 The functions below convert from a numerical vector type to another, or from one color
representation to another.


Functions


convert


      Convert numerical vectors
    



rsPackColorTo8888


      Create a uchar4 RGBA from floats
    



rsUnpackColor8888


      Create a float4 RGBA from uchar4
    



rsYuvToRGBA


      Convert a YUV value to RGBA
    


Mathematical Constants and Functions
 The mathematical functions below can be applied to scalars and vectors.   When applied
to vectors, the returned value is a vector of the function applied to each entry of the input.

 For example:
float3 a, b;
// The following call sets
//   a.x to sin(b.x),
//   a.y to sin(b.y), and
//   a.z to sin(b.z).
a = sin(b);


 See Vector Math Functions for functions like distance() and length() that interpret
instead the input as a single vector in n-dimensional space.

 The precision of the mathematical operations on 32 bit floats is affected by the pragmas
rs_fp_relaxed and rs_fp_full.  Under rs_fp_relaxed, subnormal values may be flushed to zero and
rounding may be done towards zero.  In comparison, rs_fp_full requires correct handling of
subnormal values, i.e. smaller than 1.17549435e-38f.  rs_fp_rull also requires round to nearest
with ties to even.

 Different precision/speed tradeoffs can be achieved by using variants of the common math
functions.  Functions with a name starting with
native_: May have custom hardware implementations with weaker precision.  Additionally,
  subnormal values may be flushed to zero, rounding towards zero may be used, and NaN and
  infinity input may not be handled correctly.
half_: May perform internal computations using 16 bit floats.  Additionally, subnormal
  values may be flushed to zero, and rounding towards zero may be used.

Vector Math Functions
 These functions interpret the input arguments as representation of vectors in
n-dimensional space.

 The precision of the mathematical operations on 32 bit floats is affected by the pragmas
rs_fp_relaxed and rs_fp_full.  See Mathematical Constants and Functions for details.

 Different precision/speed tradeoffs can be achieved by using variants of the common math
functions.  Functions with a name starting with
native_: May have custom hardware implementations with weaker precision.  Additionally,
  subnormal values may be flushed to zero, rounding towards zero may be used, and NaN and
  infinity input may not be handled correctly.
fast_: May perform internal computations using 16 bit floats.  Additionally, subnormal
  values may be flushed to zero, and rounding towards zero may be used.

Matrix Functions
 These functions let you manipulate square matrices of rank 2x2, 3x3, and 4x4.
They are particularly useful for graphical transformations and are compatible
with OpenGL.

 We use a zero-based index for rows and columns.  E.g. the last element of a
rs_matrix4x4 is found at (3, 3).

 RenderScript uses column-major matrices and column-based vectors.  Transforming
a vector is done by postmultiplying the vector, e.g. (matrix * vector),
as provided by rsMatrixMultiply().

 To create a transformation matrix that performs two transformations at once,
multiply the two source matrices, with the first transformation as the right
argument.  E.g. to create a transformation matrix that applies the
transformation s1 followed by s2, call rsMatrixLoadMultiply(&combined, &s2, &s1).
This derives from s2 * (s1 * v), which is (s2 * s1) * v.

 We have two style of functions to create transformation matrices:
rsMatrixLoadTransformation and rsMatrixTransformation.  The former
style simply stores the transformation matrix in the first argument.  The latter
modifies a pre-existing transformation matrix so that the new transformation
happens first.  E.g. if you call rsMatrixTranslate() on a matrix that already
does a scaling, the resulting matrix when applied to a vector will first do the
translation then the scaling.

Atomic Update Functions
 To update values shared between multiple threads, use the functions below.
They ensure that the values are atomically updated, i.e. that the memory
reads, the updates, and the memory writes are done in the right order.

 These functions are slower than their non-atomic equivalents, so use
them only when synchronization is needed.

 Note that in RenderScript, your code is likely to be running in separate
threads even though you did not explicitly create them.  The RenderScript
runtime will very often split the execution of one kernel across multiple
threads.  Updating globals should be done with atomic functions.  If possible,
modify your algorithm to avoid them altogether.

Allocation Data Access Functions
 The functions below can be used to get and set the cells that comprise
an allocation.

Individual cells are accessed using the rsGetElementAt* and
  rsSetElementAt functions.
Multiple cells can be copied using the rsAllocationCopy* and
  rsAllocationV* functions.
For getting values through a sampler, use rsSample.

The rsGetElementAt and rsSetElement* functions are somewhat misnamed.
They don't get or set elements, which are akin to data types; they get
or set cells.  Think of them as rsGetCellAt and rsSetCellAt.

Object Characteristics Functions
 The functions below can be used to query the characteristics of an Allocation, Element,
or Sampler object.  These objects are created from Java.  You can't create them from a
script.

 Allocations:
 Allocations are the primary method used to pass data to and from RenderScript kernels.

 They are a structured collection of cells that can be used to store bitmaps, textures,
arbitrary data points, etc.

 This collection of cells may have many dimensions (X, Y, Z, Array0, Array1, Array2, Array3),
faces (for cubemaps), and level of details (for mipmapping).

 See the android.renderscript.Allocation for details on to create Allocations.

 Elements:
 The term "element" is used a bit ambiguously in RenderScript, as both type information
for the cells of an Allocation and the instantiation of that type.  For example:
rs_element is a handle to a type specification, and
In functions like rsGetElementAt(), "element" means the instantiation of the type,
    i.e. a cell of an Allocation.
 The functions below let you query the characteristics of the type specificiation.

 An Element can specify a simple data types as found in C, e.g. an integer, float, or
boolean.  It can also specify a handle to a RenderScript object.  See rs_data_type for
a list of basic types.

 Elements can specify fixed size vector (of size 2, 3, or 4) versions of the basic types.
Elements can be grouped together into complex Elements, creating the equivalent of
C structure definitions.

 Elements can also have a kind, which is semantic information used to interpret pixel
data.  See rs_data_kind.

 When creating Allocations of common elements, you can simply use one of the many predefined
Elements like F32_2.

 To create complex Elements, use the Element.Builder Java class.

 Samplers:
 Samplers objects define how Allocations can be read as structure within a kernel.
See android.renderscript.S.
