    Move views using a fling animation
  



    Fling-based animation uses a friction force that is proportional to an
    object's velocity. Use it to animate a property of an object and
    want to end the animation gradually. It has an initial momentum, which is
    mostly received from the gesture velocity, and gradually slows down. The
    animation comes to an end when the velocity of the animation is low enough
    that it makes no visible change on the device screen.

      using spring physics

Add the support library
To use the physics-based support library, you must add the support library to your project
    as follows:
    

Open the build.gradle file for your app module.
Add the support library to the dependencies section.
  
  dependencies {
      implementation 'com.android.support:support-dynamic-animation:28.0.0'
  }
  


Create a fling animation

    The FlingAnimation class lets you create
    a fling animation for an object. To build a fling animation, create an
    instance of the FlingAnimation class and
    provide an object and the object's property that you want to animate.
  
Kotlin

val fling = FlingAnimation(view, DynamicAnimation.SCROLL_X)

Java

FlingAnimation fling = new FlingAnimation(view, DynamicAnimation.SCROLL_X);


Set velocity

    The starting velocity defines the speed at which an animation property
    changes at the beginning of the animation. The default starting velocity is
    set to zero pixels per second. Therefore, you must define a start velocity
    to ensure the animation does not end right away.
  

    You can use a fixed value as the starting velocity, or you can base it off
    of the velocity of a touch gesture. If you choose to provide a fixed value,
    you should define the value in dp per second, then convert it to pixels
    per second. Defining the value in dp per second allows the velocity to be
    independent of a device's density and form factors. For more information about
    converting the starting velocity to pixels per second, refer to the
    Converting
    dp per second to pixels per second section in
    Spring Animation.
  

    To set the velocity, call the setStartVelocity() method and pass
    the velocity in pixels per second. The method returns the fling object on
    which the velocity is set.
  
Note: Use the
    GestureDetector.OnGestureListener and the
    VelocityTracker classes to retrieve and compute
    the velocity of touch gestures, respectively.
  
Set an animation value range

    You can set the minimum and the maximum animation values when you want to
    restrain the property value to a certain range. This range control is
    particularly useful when you animate properties that have an intrinsic
    range, such as alpha (from 0 to 1).
  
Note: When the value of a fling animation reaches the
    minimum or maximum value, the animation ends.
  

    To set the minimum and maximum values, call the setMinValue()
    and setMaxValue() methods, respectively.
    Both methods return the animation object for which you have set the value.
  
Set friction

    The setFriction() method lets you change the animation's
    friction. It defines how quickly the velocity decreases in an animation.
Note: If you don't set the friction at the beginning of
    the animation, the animation uses a default friction value of 1.
  

    The method returns the object whose animation uses the friction value you
    provide.
  
Sample code

    The example below illustrates a horizontal fling. The velocity captured from
    the velocity tracker is velocityX and, the scroll bounds are
    set to 0 and
    maxScroll. The friction is set to 1.1.
  
Kotlin

FlingAnimation(view, DynamicAnimation.SCROLL_X).apply {
    setStartVelocity(-velocityX)
    setMinValue(0f)
    setMaxValue(maxScroll)
    friction = 1.1f
    start()
}

Java

FlingAnimation fling = new FlingAnimation(view, DynamicAnimation.SCROLL_X);
fling.setStartVelocity(-velocityX)
        .setMinValue(0)
        .setMaxValue(maxScroll)
        .setFriction(1.1f)
        .start();


Set the minimum visible change

    When you animate a custom property that isn't defined in pixels, you should set the
    minimal change of animation value that is visible to users. It
    determines a reasonable threshold for ending the animation.
It isn't necessary to call this method when animating
    DynamicAnimation.ViewProperty because the
    minimum visible change is derived from the property. For example:
  

The default minimum visible change value is 1 pixel for view
      properties such as TRANSLATION_X, TRANSLATION_Y,
      TRANSLATION_Z, SCROLL_X, and
      SCROLL_Y.
For animations that use rotation, such as ROTATION,
      ROTATION_X, and ROTATION_Y, the minimum visible
      change is MIN_VISIBLE_CHANGE_ROTATION_DEGREES, or 1/10 pixel.
For animations that use opacity, the minimum visible change is
      MIN_VISIBLE_CHANGE_ALPHA, or 1/256.


    To set the minimum visible change for an animation, call the
    setMinimumVisibleChange() method and pass either
    one of the minimum visible constants or a value that you need to calculate
    for a custom property. For more information on calculating this value,
    refer to the
    Calculating a minimum visible change value
    section.
  
Kotlin

anim.minimumVisibleChange = DynamicAnimation.MIN_VISIBLE_CHANGE_SCALE

Java

anim.setMinimumVisibleChange(DynamicAnimation.MIN_VISIBLE_CHANGE_SCALE);


Note: You need to pass a value only when you animate a
  custom property that is not defined in pixels.
Calculating a minimum visible change value

    To calculate the minimum visible change value for a custom property, use the
    following formula:
Minimum visible change = Range of custom property value / Range of
      animiation in pixels
  

    For example, the property that you want to animate progresses from 0 to
    100. This corresponds to a 200-pixel change. Per the formula, the minimum
    visible change value is 100 / 200 is equal to 0.5 pixels.
