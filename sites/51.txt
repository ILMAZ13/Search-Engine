    Support display cutouts
  







A display cutout is an area on some devices that extends into the display
surface to allow for an edge-to-edge experience while providing space for
important sensors on the front of the device. Android officially supports
display cutouts on devices running Android 9 (API level 28) and higher. Note
that device manufacturers can also choose to support display cutouts on devices
running Android 8.1 or lower.
This topic describes how to implement support for devices with cutouts, including
how to work with the cutout area--that is, the edge-to-edge rectangle on the
display surface that contains the cutout.
What to expect on devices with display cutouts
To ensure consistency and app compatibility, devices running Android 9 must
ensure the following cutout behavior:

A single edge can contain at most one cutout.
A device cannot have more than two cutouts.
A device cannot have cutouts on either of its longer edges.
In portrait orientation with no special flags set, the status bar must extend
to at least the height of the cutout.
By default, in fullscreen or landscape orientation, the entire cutout area
must be letterboxed.

Choose how your app handles cutout areas
If you don't want your content to overlap with a cutout
area, making sure that your content does not overlap with the status bar and
the navigation bar is generally sufficient. If you are rendering into the cutout
area, you can use 
WindowInsets.getDisplayCutout() to retrieve a
DisplayCutout object that
contains the safe insets and bounding box for each cutout. These APIs let you
check whether your content overlaps with the cutout so that you can reposition,
if needed.
Note: To manage your cutout implementation across multiple API levels, you can
also use DisplayCutoutCompat
in the AndroidX library,
which is available through the SDK manager.
Android also allows you to control whether to display content inside of the
cutout area. The window layout attribute
layoutInDisplayCutoutMode
controls how your content is drawn in the cutout area. You can set
layoutInDisplayCutoutMode to one of the following values:

LAYOUT_IN_DISPLAY_CUTOUT_MODE_DEFAULT -
This is the default behavior, as described above. Content renders into the cutout area while in
portrait mode, but content is letterboxed while in landscape mode.
LAYOUT_IN_DISPLAY_CUTOUT_MODE_SHORT_EDGES -
Content renders into the cutout area in both portrait and landscape modes.
LAYOUT_IN_DISPLAY_CUTOUT_MODE_NEVER -
Content never renders into the cutout area.

You can set the cutout mode either programmatically or by setting a style in
your activity. The example below defines a style
that you can use to apply the LAYOUT_IN_DISPLAY_CUTOUT_MODE_SHORT_EDGES
attribute to the activity.

<style name="ActivityTheme">
  <item name="android:windowLayoutInDisplayCutoutMode">
    shortEdges <!-- default, shortEdges, never -->
  </item>
</style>

The sections below describe the different cutout modes in more detail.
Default behavior
By default, in portrait mode with no special flags set,
the status bar on a device with a cutout is resized to be at least as tall as
the cutout, and your content displays in the area below. In landscape or
fullscreen mode, your app window is letterboxed so that none of your content
displays in the cutout area.
Render content in short edge cutout areas
For some content, such as videos, photos, maps, and games, rendering in the
cutout area can be a great way to provide a more immersive, edge-to-edge
experience for users. With
LAYOUT_IN_DISPLAY_CUTOUT_MODE_SHORT_EDGES,
the content extends into the cutout area on the short edge of the display in
both portrait and landscape, regardless of whether the system bars are hidden
or visible. Note that the window can never extend into a cutout area
on the long edges of the screen. When using this mode, be sure that no
important content overlaps with the cutout area.
Note that Android might not allow the content view to overlap the system bars.
To override this behavior and force content to extend into the cutout area,
apply any of the following flags to the view visibility via the
View.setSystemUiVisibility(int)
method:

SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_FULLSCREEN
SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_HIDE_NAVIGATION
SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_STABLE

Here are some examples of LAYOUT_IN_DISPLAY_CUTOUT_MODE_SHORT_EDGES:










Note that a cutout in the corner is considered to be on the short edge, so the
same behavior applies:



Never render content in the display cutout area
With LAYOUT_IN_DISPLAY_CUTOUT_MODE_NEVER,
the window is never allowed to overlap with the cutout area.
This mode should be used with windows that transiently set
View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_FULLSCREEN or
View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_HIDE_NAVIGATION
to avoid performing another layout of the window when the flag is set or cleared.
See examples of LAYOUT_IN_DISPLAY_CUTOUT_MODE_NEVER below:






Special mode
Some devices running Android 8.1 (API level 27) or earlier support a
special mode that lets users extend a letterboxed fullscreen or landscape app
into the cutout area. This mode is typically controlled with a toggle in the
navigation bar that presents a dialog that requires confirmation before
extending the screen.



Best practices for display cutout support
When working with display cutouts, be sure to
consider the following:

Don't let the cutout area obscure any important text,
controls, or other information.
Don't place or extend any interactive elements that require fine touch
recognition into the cutout area. Touch sensitivity might be lower in the
cutout area.
Avoid hard-coding the status bar height, as this can lead to
overlapping or cut-off content. Where possible,
use WindowInsetsCompat
to retrieve the status bar height and determine the appropriate padding to apply to
your content.



Don't assume that the app has the entire window. Instead, confirm its
location by using View.getLocationInWindow().
Don't use View.getLocationOnScreen().
Be sure to properly handle transitions into and out of fullscreen mode.
this Android Developers blog post .
With default cutout behavior in portrait mode, if the cutout area is at the top edge and the
window did not set FLAG_FULLSCREEN
or View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_FULLSCREEN,
the window can extend into the cutout area. Similarly, if the
cutout area is at the bottom edge and the window did not set
View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_HIDE_NAVIGATION,
the window can extend into the cutout area. In fullscreen or landscape modes,
the window is laid out such that it does not overlap with the cutout area.
Use shortEdges or never cutout modes if your app needs to transition into and out
of fullscreen mode. Default cutout behavior can cause content in your app to
move up and down during transitions, as demonstrated in the image below:



In fullscreen mode, be careful using window versus screen coordinates, as
your app does not take up the whole screen when letterboxed. Because of the
letterbox, coordinates from the screen origin are no longer the same as
coordinates from the window origin. You can transform screen coordinates to the
view’s coordinates as needed by using
getLocationOnScreen().
The image below shows how coordinates differ when content is letterboxed:



When handling MotionEvent, use
MotionEvent.getX() and
MotionEvent.getY() to avoid
similar coordinate issues. Don't use
MotionEvent.getRawX() or
MotionEvent.getRawY().

Test how your content renders





Be sure to test all of your app's screens and experiences. Test on devices with
different types of cutouts, if possible. If you don't have a device with a cutout, you can
simulate some common cutout configurations on any device or emulator running
Android 9 by doing the following:

Enable developer options.
In the Developer options screen, scroll down to the Drawing section,
and select Simulate a display with a cutout.
Select the cutout type.
