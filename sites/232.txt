    RenderScript Time Functions and Types
  



Overview
The functions below can be used to tell the current clock time and the current
system up time.  It is not recommended to call these functions inside of a kernel.

Summary

Types


rs_time_t


      Seconds since January 1, 1970
    



rs_tm


      Date and time structure
    



Functions


rsGetDt


      Elapsed time since last call
    



rsLocaltime


      Convert to local time
    



rsTime


      Seconds since January 1, 1970
    



rsUptimeMillis


      System uptime in milliseconds
    



rsUptimeNanos


      System uptime in nanoseconds
    


Types



rs_time_t
: Seconds since January 1, 1970


A typedef of: int     When compiling for 32 bits.

A typedef of: long     When compiling for 64 bits.

 Calendar time interpreted as seconds elapsed since the Epoch (00:00:00 on
January 1, 1970, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)).






rs_tm
: Date and time structure


A structure with the following fields:     

int tm_secSeconds after the minute. This ranges from 0 to 59, but possibly up to 60 for leap seconds.
int tm_minMinutes after the hour. This ranges from 0 to 59.
int tm_hourHours past midnight. This ranges from 0 to 23.
int tm_mdayDay of the month. This ranges from 1 to 31.
int tm_monMonths since January. This ranges from 0 to 11.
int tm_yearYears since 1900.
int tm_wdayDays since Sunday. This ranges from 0 to 6.
int tm_ydayDays since January 1. This ranges from 0 to 365.
int tm_isdstFlag to indicate whether daylight saving time is in effect. The value is positive if it is in effect, zero if it is not, and negative if the information is not available.

 Data structure for broken-down time components.



Functions



rsGetDt
: Elapsed time since last call




float rsGetDt();

 



 Returns

Time in seconds.



 Returns the time in seconds since this function was last called in this script.






rsLocaltime
: Convert to local time




rs_tm* rsLocaltime(rs_tm* local, const rs_time_t* timer);

 



 Parameters

localPointer to time structure where the local time will be stored.
timerInput time as a number of seconds since January 1, 1970.


 Returns

Pointer to the output local time, i.e. the same value as the parameter local.



 Converts the time specified by timer into a rs_tm structure that provides year, month,
hour, etc.  This value is stored at *local.

 This functions returns the same pointer that is passed as first argument.  If the
local parameter is NULL, this function does nothing and returns NULL.






rsTime
: Seconds since January 1, 1970




rs_time_t rsTime(rs_time_t* timer);

 



 Parameters

timerLocation to also store the returned calendar time.


 Returns

Seconds since the Epoch, -1 if there's an error.



 Returns the number of seconds since the Epoch (00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970).

 If timer is non-NULL, the result is also stored in the memory pointed to by
this variable.






rsUptimeMillis
: System uptime in milliseconds




int64_t rsUptimeMillis();

 



 Returns

Uptime in milliseconds.



 Returns the current system clock (uptime) in milliseconds.






rsUptimeNanos
: System uptime in nanoseconds




int64_t rsUptimeNanos();

 



 Returns

Uptime in nanoseconds.



 Returns the current system clock (uptime) in nanoseconds.

 The granularity of the values return by this call may be much larger than a nanosecond.
