    Layout resource
  


A layout resource defines the architecture for the UI in an Activity or a component of a UI.

file location:
res/layout/filename.xml
The filename will be used as the resource ID.
compiled resource datatype:
Resource pointer to a View (or subclass) resource.
resource reference:

In Java: R.layout.filename
In XML: @[package:]layout/filename

syntax:


<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<ViewGroup
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:id="@[+][package:]id/resource_name"
    android:layout_height=["dimension" | "match_parent" | "wrap_content"]
    android:layout_width=["dimension" | "match_parent" | "wrap_content"]
    [ViewGroup-specific attributes] >
    <View
        android:id="@[+][package:]id/resource_name"
        android:layout_height=["dimension" | "match_parent" | "wrap_content"]
        android:layout_width=["dimension" | "match_parent" | "wrap_content"]
        [View-specific attributes] >
        <requestFocus/>
    </View>
    <ViewGroup >
        <View />
    </ViewGroup>
    <include layout="@layout/layout_resource"/>
</ViewGroup>

Note: The root element can be either a
ViewGroup, a View, or a <merge> element, but there must be only
one root element and it must contain the xmlns:android attribute with the android
namespace as shown.

elements:


<ViewGroup>
A container for other View elements. There are many
    different kinds of ViewGroup objects and each one lets you
    specify the layout of the child elements in different ways. Different kinds of
    ViewGroup objects include LinearLayout,
    RelativeLayout, and FrameLayout.
    You should not assume that any derivation of ViewGroup
    will accept nested Views. Some ViewGroups
    are implementations of the AdapterView class, which determines
    its children only from an Adapter.
attributes:

android:id
Resource ID. A unique resource name for the element, which you can
use to obtain a reference to the ViewGroup from your application. See more
about the value for android:id below.
        
android:layout_height
Dimension or keyword. Required. The height for the group, as a
dimension value (or
dimension resource) or a keyword
("match_parent" or "wrap_content"). See the valid values below.
        
android:layout_width
Dimension or keyword. Required. The width for the group, as a
dimension value (or
dimension resource) or a keyword
("match_parent" or "wrap_content"). See the valid values below.
        

More attributes are supported by the ViewGroup
      base class, and many more are supported by each implementation of
      ViewGroup. For a reference of all available attributes,
      see the corresponding reference documentation for the ViewGroup class
(for example, the LinearLayout XML
attributes).

<View>
An individual UI component, generally referred to as a "widget". Different
    kinds of View objects include TextView,
    Button, and CheckBox.
      attributes:

android:id
Resource ID. A unique resource name for the element, which you can use to
          obtain a reference to the View from your application. See more about
the value for android:id below.
        
android:layout_height
Dimension or keyword. Required. The height for the element, as
a dimension value (or
dimension resource) or a keyword
("match_parent" or "wrap_content"). See the valid values below.
        
android:layout_width
Dimension or keyword. Required. The width for the element, as
a dimension value (or
dimension resource) or a keyword
("match_parent" or "wrap_content"). See the valid values below.
        

More attributes are supported by the View
      base class, and many more are supported by each implementation of
      View. Read Layouts for more information. For
a reference of all available attributes,
      see the corresponding reference documentation (for example, the TextView XML attributes).

<requestFocus>
Any element representing a View object can include this empty element,
    which gives its parent initial focus on the screen. You can have only one of these
    elements per file.
<include>
Includes a layout file into this layout.
      attributes:

layout
Layout resource. Required. Reference to a layout
resource.
android:id
Resource ID. Overrides the ID given to the root view in the included layout.
        
android:layout_height
Dimension or keyword. Overrides the height given to the root view in the
included layout. Only effective if android:layout_width is also declared.
        
android:layout_width
Dimension or keyword. Overrides the width given to the root view in the
included layout. Only effective if android:layout_height is also declared.
        

You can include any other layout attributes in the <include> that are
supported by the root element in the included layout and they will override those defined in the
root element.
Caution: If you want to override layout attributes using
      the <include> tag, you must override both
      android:layout_height and android:layout_width in order for
      other layout attributes to take effect.
Another way to include a layout is to use ViewStub. It is a lightweight
View that consumes no layout space until you explicitly inflate it, at which point, it includes a
layout file defined by its android:layout attribute. For more information about using ViewStub, read Loading
  Views On Demand.

<merge>
An alternative root element that is not drawn in the layout hierarchy. Using this as the
root element is useful when you know that this layout will be placed into a layout
that already contains the appropriate parent View to contain the children of the
<merge> element. This is particularly useful when you plan to include this layout
in another layout file using <include> and
this layout doesn't require a different ViewGroup container. For more
information about merging layouts, read Re-using Layouts with <include/>.

Value for android:id
For the ID value, you should usually use this syntax form: "@+id/name". The
plus symbol, +, indicates that this is a new resource ID and the aapt tool will
create a new resource integer in the R.java class, if it doesn't already exist. For
example:

<TextView android:id="@+id/nameTextbox"/>

The nameTextbox name is now a resource ID attached to this element. You can then
refer to the TextView to which the ID is associated in Java:
Kotlin

val textView: TextView? = findViewById(R.id.nameTextbox)

Java

TextView textView = findViewById(R.id.nameTextbox);


This code returns the TextView object.
However, if you have already defined an ID resource (and it is not
already used), then you can apply that ID to a View element by excluding the
plus symbol in the android:id value.
Value for android:layout_height and
android:layout_width:
The height and width value can be expressed using any of the
  dimension
  units supported by Android (px, dp, sp, pt, in, mm) or with the following keywords:
ValueDescription

match_parent
Sets the dimension to match that of the parent element. Added in API Level 8 to
deprecate fill_parent.


wrap_content
Sets the dimension only to the size required to fit the content of this element.


Custom View elements
You can create your own custom View and ViewGroup
elements and apply them to your layout the same as a standard layout
element. You can also specify the attributes supported in the XML element. To learn more,
see the Custom Components developer
guide.

 
example:
XML file saved at res/layout/main_activity.xml:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
              android:layout_width="match_parent"
              android:layout_height="match_parent"
              android:orientation="vertical" >
    <TextView android:id="@+id/text"
              android:layout_width="wrap_content"
              android:layout_height="wrap_content"
              android:text="Hello, I am a TextView" />
    <Button android:id="@+id/button"
            android:layout_width="wrap_content"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:text="Hello, I am a Button" />
</LinearLayout>

This application code will load the layout for an Activity, in the
    onCreate() method:
    
Kotlin

public override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    setContentView(R.layout.main_activity)
}

Java

public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.main_activity);
}
