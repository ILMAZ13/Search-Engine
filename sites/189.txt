Learn how to use the Cronet Library to perform network operations in your
Android app. Cronet is the Chromium network stack made available as a library
for you to use in your apps. For more information about the library features,
see Perform network operations using
Cronet.
Set up the library in your project
Follow these steps to add a dependency to the Cronet Library in your project:

Add a reference to Google's Maven Repository in your project's top-level
build.gradle file, as shown in the following example:
allprojects {
  repositories {
    …
    google()
  }
}

Include a reference to the Cronet Library in the dependencies section of
your app module's build.gradle file, as shown in the following example:
dependencies {
  implementation 'org.chromium.net:cronet-embedded:72.3626.96'
}
Note: The cronet-embedded dependency includes the complete Cronet
  implementation into your app, which increases the size of your APK file by
  2-5 MB. Using the cronet-embedded dependency requires you to release
  updates to your app with the latest version of the library at least every
  six weeks.

Create a network request
This section shows how to create and send a network request using the Cronet
Library. After sending the network request, your app should process the network
response.
Create and configure an instance of CronetEngine
The library provides a
CronetEngine.Builder class
that you can use to create an instance of
CronetEngine. The following example
shows how to create a CronetEngine object:
CronetEngine.Builder myBuilder = new CronetEngine.Builder(context);
CronetEngine cronetEngine = myBuilder.build();
Note: It's recommended to create only one instance of CronetEngine. A single
instance can send multiple asynchronous requests. Additionally, a
storage directory doesn't support concurrent access by multiple CronetEngine
instances. For more information, see
setStoragePath().
You can use the Builder class to configure a
CronetEngine object, for example you can
provide options like caching and data compresssion. For more information, see
CronetEngine.Builder.
Provide an implementation of the request callback
To provide an implementation of the callback, create a subclass of
UrlRequest.Callback and
implement the required abstract methods, as shown in the following example:
class MyUrlRequestCallback extends UrlRequest.Callback {
  private static final String TAG = "MyUrlRequestCallback";

  @Override
  public void onRedirectReceived(UrlRequest request, UrlResponseInfo info, String newLocationUrl) {
    android.util.Log.i(TAG, "onRedirectReceived method called.");
    // You should call the request.followRedirect() method to continue
    // processing the request.
    request.followRedirect();
  }

  @Override
  public void onResponseStarted(UrlRequest request, UrlResponseInfo info) {
    android.util.Log.i(TAG, "onResponseStarted method called.");
    // You should call the request.read() method before the request can be
    // further processed. The following instruction provides a ByteBuffer object
    // with a capacity of 102400 bytes to the read() method.
    request.read(ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(102400));
  }

  @Override
  public void onReadCompleted(UrlRequest request, UrlResponseInfo info, ByteBuffer byteBuffer) {
    android.util.Log.i(TAG, "onReadCompleted method called.");
    // You should keep reading the request until there's no more data.
    request.read(ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(102400));
  }

  @Override
  public void onSucceeded(UrlRequest request, UrlResponseInfo info) {
    android.util.Log.i(TAG, "onSucceeded method called.");
  }
}
Note: For simplicity, the previous code example creates an implementation of
UrlRequest.Callback that writes
a message to the log when a network event happens. To learn more details about
how to implement the callback, see Process the network response.
Create an Executor object to manage network tasks
You can use the Executor class to execute network
tasks.
To get an instance of Executor, use one of the
static methods of the Executors class that return
an Executor object. The following example shows how to create an Executor
object using the newSingleThreadExecutor()
method:
Executor executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();

Create and configure a UrlRequest object
To create the network request, call the
newUrlRequestBuilder()
method of the CronetEngine passing the
destination URL, an instance of your callback class, and the executor object.
The newUrlRequestBuilder() method returns a
UrlRequest.Builder object that
you can use to create the UrlRequest
object, as shown in the following example:
UrlRequest.Builder requestBuilder = cronetEngine.newUrlRequestBuilder(
        "https://www.example.com", new MyUrlRequestCallback(), executor);

UrlRequest request = requestBuilder.build();

You can use the Builder class to
configure the instance of UrlRequest. For
example, you can specify a priority or the HTTP verb. For more information, see
UrlRequest.Builder.
To start the network task, call the
start() method of the request:
request.start();

By following the instructions in this section, you can create and send a network
request using Cronet. However, for the sake of simplicity, the example
implementation of
UrlRequest.Callback only prints
a message to the log. The following section shows how to provide a callback
implementation that supports more useful scenarios, such as extracting data from
the response and detecting a failure in the request.
Process the network response
Once you call the start()
method, the Cronet request lifecycle is initiated. Your app should manage the
request during the lifecycle by specifying a callback. To learn more about the
lifecycle, see Cronet request
lifecycle. You can specify a
callback by creating a subclass of
UrlRequest.Callback and
implementing the following methods:

onRedirectReceived()
Invoked when the server issues an HTTP redirect code in response to the
original request. To follow the redirect to the new destination, use the
followRedirect()
method. Otherwise use the cancel()
method. The following example shows how to implement the method:
@Override
public void onRedirectReceived(UrlRequest request, UrlResponseInfo info, String newLocationUrl) {
  // Determine whether you want to follow the redirect.
  …

  if (shouldFollow) {
    request.followRedirect();
  } else {
    request.cancel();
  }
}

onResponseStarted()
Invoked when the final set of headers is received. The onResponseStarted()
method is only invoked after all redirects are followed. The following code
shows an example implementation of the method:
@Override
public void onResponseStarted(UrlRequest request, UrlResponseInfo responseInfo) {
  int httpStatusCode = responseInfo.getHttpStatusCode();
  if (httpStatusCode == 200) {
    // The request was fulfilled. Start reading the response.
    request.read(myBuffer);
  } else if (httpStatusCode == 503) {
    // The service is unavailable. You should still check if the request
    // contains some data.
    request.read(myBuffer);
  }
  mResponseHeaders = responseInfo.getAllHeaders();
}
Note: Status codes 4xx and 5xx aren't considered errors from Cronet's
  perspective. You should still try to read the response using the
  read() method
  because the it could contain some data. You can also cancel the request
  using the cancel() method.
  These actions ensure that the request is taken to a final state.
onReadCompleted()
Invoked whenever part of the response body has been read. The following code
example shows how to implement the method and extract the response body:
@Override
public void onReadCompleted(UrlRequest request, UrlResponseInfo responseInfo, ByteBuffer byteBuffer) {
  // The response body is available, process byteBuffer.
  …

  // Continue reading the response body by reusing the same buffer
  // until the response has been completed.
  byteBuffer.clear();
  request.read(myBuffer);
}

onSucceeded()
Invoked when the network request is completed successfully. The following
example shows how to implement the method:
@Override
public void onSucceeded(UrlRequest request, UrlResponseInfo responseInfo) {
  // The request has completed successfully.
}

onFailed()
Invoked if the request failed for any reason after the
start() method was called. The
following example shows how to implement the method and get information about
the error:
@Override
public void onFailed(UrlRequest request, UrlResponseInfo responseInfo, CronetException error) {
  // The request has failed. If possible, handle the error.
  Log.e(TAG, "The request failed.", error);
}

onCanceled()
Invoked if the request was canceled using the
cancel() method. Once invoked, no
other methods of the
UrlRequest.Callback class are
invoked. You can use this method to free resources allocated to process a
request. The following example shows how to implement the method:
@Override
public void onCanceled(UrlRequest request, UrlResponseInfo responseInfo) {
  // Free resources allocated to process this request.
  …
}
