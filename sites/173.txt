    Detect when users start or end an activity
  


It might be necessary to design your app to identify when a user starts or stops
a particular activity, such as walking, biking, or driving. For example, a
mileage tracking app could start tracking miles when a user starts driving, or a
messaging app could mute all conversations until the user stops driving.
The Activity Recognition Transition API can be used to detect changes in the
user's activity. Your app subscribes to a transition in activities of interest
and the API notifies your app only when needed. This page shows how to use the
Activity Recognition Transition API, also called the Transition API for short.
Set up your project
To use the Transition API in your app, you must declare a dependency to the
Google Location and Activity Recognition API version 12.0.0 or higher and
specify the com.google.android.gms.permission.ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION permission
in the app manifest.

To declare a dependency to the API, add a reference to the Google maven
repository and add an implementation entry to
com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:12.0.0 to the dependencies
section of your app build.gradle file. For more information, see Set Up
Google Play Services.
To specify the com.google.android.gms.permission.ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION
permission, add a
<uses-permission>
element in the app manifest, as shown in the following example:
 <manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
         package="com.example.myapp">

   <uses-permission android:name="com.google.android.gms.permission.ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION" />
   …
 </manifest>


Register for activity transition updates
To start receiving notifications about activity transitions, you must implement
the following:

An
ActivityTransitionRequest
object that specifies the type of activity and transition.
A PendingIntent callback where your app receives
notifications. For more information, see Using a pending
intent.

To create the
ActivityTransitionRequest
object, you must create a list of
ActivityTransition
objects, which represent the transition that you want to receive notifications
about. An
ActivityTransition
object includes the following data:

An activity type, represented by the
DetectedActivity
class. The Transition API supports the following activities:

IN_VEHICLE
ON_BICYCLE
RUNNING
STILL
WALKING

A transition type of
ACTIVITY_TRANSITION_ENTER
or
ACTIVITY_TRANSITION_EXIT.
For more information, refer to the
ActivityTransition
class.

The following code shows how to create a list of ActivityTransition objects:
List<ActivityTransition> transitions = new ArrayList<>();

transitions.add(
  new ActivityTransition.Builder()
    .setActivityType(DetectedActivity.IN_VEHICLE)
    .setActivityTransition(ActivityTransition.ACTIVITY_TRANSITION_ENTER)
    .build());

transitions.add(
  new ActivityTransition.Builder()
    .setActivityType(DetectedActivity.IN_VEHICLE)
    .setActivityTransition(ActivityTransition.ACTIVITY_TRANSITION_EXIT)
    .build());

transitions.add(
  new ActivityTransition.Builder()
    .setActivityType(DetectedActivity.WALKING)
    .setActivityTransition(ActivityTransition.ACTIVITY_TRANSITION_EXIT)
    .build());

You can create an
ActivityTransitionRequest
object by passing the list of ActivityTransitions to the
ActivityTransitionRequest class, as shown in the following example:
ActivityTransitionRequest request = new ActivityTransitionRequest(transitions);

You can register for activity transition updates by passing your instance of
ActivityTransitionRequest
and your PendingIntent object to the
requestActivityTransitionUpdates()
method. The requestActivityTransitionUpdates() method returns a
Task
object that you can check for success or failure, as shown in the following code
example:
// myPendingIntent is the instance of PendingIntent where the app receives callbacks.
Task<Void> task =
  ActivityRecognition.getClient(context).requestActivityTransitionUpdates(request, myPendingIntent);

  task.addOnSuccessListener(
    new OnSuccessListener<Void>() {
      @Override
      public void onSuccess(Void result) {
        // Handle success
      }
    }
  );

  task.addOnFailureListener(
    new OnFailureListener() {
      @Override
      public void onFailure(Exception e) {
        // Handle error
      }
    }
  );

After successfully registering for activity transition updates, your app
receives notifications in the registered PendingIntent.
Process activity transition events
When the requested activity transition occurs, you app receives an Intent callback. An
ActivityTransitionResult
object can be extracted from the Intent, which includes a list of
ActivityTransitionEvent
objects. The events are ordered in chronological order, for example, if an app
requests for the
IN_VEHICLE
activity type on the
ACTIVITY_TRANSITION_ENTER
and
ACTIVITY_TRANSITION_EXIT
transitions, then it receives an ActivityTransitionEvent object when the user
starts driving, and another one when the user transitions to any other activity.
You can implement your callback by creating a subclass of BroadcastReceiver and implementing the onReceive() method to get the list
of activity transition events. For more information, see
Broadcasts. The following example shows how
to implement the onReceive() method:
@Override
protected void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
  if (ActivityTransitionResult.hasResult(intent)) {
    ActivityTransitionResult result = ActivityTransitionResult.extractResult(intent);
    for (ActivityTransitionEvent event : result.getTransitionEvents()) {
        // chronological sequence of events....
    }
  }
}
Note: The latency of event detection might vary by device.
Deregister for activity transition updates
You can deregister for activity transition updates by calling the
removeActivityTransitionUpdates()
method of the
ActivityRecognitionClient
and passing your PendingIntent object as a parameter, as
shown in the following example:
// myPendingIntent is the instance of PendingIntent where the app receives callbacks.
Task<Void> task =
  ActivityRecognition.getClient(context).removeActivityTransitionUpdates(myPendingIntent);

task.addOnSuccessListener(
  new OnSuccessListener<Void>() {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess(Void result) {
      myPendingIntent.cancel();
    }
  });

task.addOnFailureListener(
  new OnFailureListener() {
    @Override
    public void onFailure(Exception e) {
      Log.e("MYCOMPONENT", e.getMessage());
    }
  });
