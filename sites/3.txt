    Handle configuration changes
  


Some device configurations can change during runtime (such as screen orientation, keyboard
availability, and when the user enables 
multi-window mode). When such a change occurs, Android restarts the running
Activity (
onDestroy() is called, followed by

onCreate()). The restart behavior is designed to help
your application adapt to new configurations by automatically reloading your application with
alternative resources that match the new device configuration.
To properly handle a restart, it is important that your activity restores its previous
state. You can use a combination of

onSaveInstanceState(),
ViewModel objects, and persistent storage to save and
restore the UI state of your activity across configuration changes. For more information on how to
save your Activity state, read Saving UI States.
To test that your application restarts itself with the application state intact, you should
invoke configuration changes (such as changing the screen orientation) while performing various
tasks in your application. Your application should be able to restart at any time without loss of
user data or state in order to handle events such as configuration changes or when the user receives
an incoming phone call and then returns to your application much later after your application
process may have been destroyed. To learn how you can restore your activity state, read about the Activity lifecycle.
However, you might encounter a situation in which restarting your application and
restoring significant amounts of data can be costly and create a poor user experience. In such a
situation, you have two other options:

Retain an object during a configuration change
Allow your activity to restart when a configuration changes, but carry a stateful
object to the new instance of your activity.

Handle the configuration change yourself
It is not recommended to handle configuration changes yourself due to the hidden complexity of
handling the configuration changes. However, if you are unable to preserve your UI state using the
preferred options (onSaveInstanceState(), ViewModels, and persistent storage) you can instead
prevent the system from restarting your activity during certain configuration
changes. Your app will receive a callback when the configurations do change so that you can
manually update your activity as necessary.


Retaining an object during a configuration change
If restarting your activity requires that you recover large sets of data, re-establish a network
connection, or perform other intensive operations, then a full restart due to a configuration change
might be a slow user experience. Also, it might not be possible for you to completely restore your
activity state with the Bundle that the system saves for you with the

onSaveInstanceState() callback—it is not
designed to carry large objects (such as bitmaps) and the data within it must be serialized then
deserialized on the main thread, which can consume a lot of memory and make the configuration
change slow. In such a
situation, you can alleviate the burden of reinitializing part of your activity by using a
ViewModel object. ViewModels are preserved across
configuration changes so they are the perfect place to keep your UI data without having to query
them again. For more infomation on using ViewModels in your apps, read the
ViewModel guide.
Handling the configuration change yourself
If your application doesn't need to update resources during a specific configuration
change and you have a performance limitation that requires you to
avoid the activity restart, then you can declare that your activity handles the configuration change
itself which prevents the system from restarting your activity.
Caution: Handling the configuration change yourself can make it much
more difficult to use alternative resources, because the system does not automatically apply them
for you. This technique should be considered a last resort when you must avoid restarts due to a
configuration change and is not recommended for most applications.
To declare that your activity handles a configuration change, edit the appropriate <activity> element in
your manifest file to include the android:configChanges
attribute with a value that represents the configuration you want to
handle. Possible values are listed in the documentation for the android:configChanges
attribute. The most commonly used values are "orientation", "screenSize",
and "keyboardHidden". The "orientation" value prevents restarts
when the screen orientation changes. The "screenSize" value also prevents restarts
when orientation changes, but beginning in Android 3.2 (API level 13). If you want to manually
handle configuration changes in your app you must declare both the "orientation" and
"screenSize" values in the android:configChanges attributes. The
"keyboardHidden" value prevents restarts when the keyboard availability changes.
You can declare multiple configuration values in the attribute by separating them with a pipe
| character.
For example, the following manifest code declares an activity that handles both the
screen orientation change and keyboard availability change:

<activity android:name=".MyActivity"
          android:configChanges="orientation|keyboardHidden"
          android:label="@string/app_name">

Now, when one of these configurations change, MyActivity does not restart.
Instead, the MyActivity receives a call to

onConfigurationChanged(). This method
is passed a Configuration object that specifies
the new device configuration. By reading fields in the Configuration,
you can determine the new configuration and make appropriate changes by updating
the resources used in your interface. At the
time this method is called, your activity's Resources object is updated
to return resources based on the new configuration, so you can easily
reset elements of your UI without the system restarting your activity.
For example, the following onConfigurationChanged() implementation
checks the current device orientation:

@Override
public void onConfigurationChanged(Configuration newConfig) {
    super.onConfigurationChanged(newConfig);

    // Checks the orientation of the screen
    if (newConfig.orientation == Configuration.ORIENTATION_LANDSCAPE) {
        Toast.makeText(this, "landscape", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    } else if (newConfig.orientation == Configuration.ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT){
        Toast.makeText(this, "portrait", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    }
}

The Configuration object represents all of the current
configurations, not just the ones that have changed. Most of the time, you won't care exactly how
the configuration has changed and can simply re-assign all your resources that provide alternatives
to the configuration that you're handling. For example, because the
Resources object is now updated, you can reset
any ImageViews with setImageResource()
and the appropriate resource for the new configuration is used (as described in Providing Resources).
Notice that the values from the
  Configuration fields are integers
that are matched to specific constants
from the Configuration class. For documentation about which constants
to use with each field, refer to the appropriate field in the
Configuration reference.
Remember: When you declare your activity to handle a configuration
change, you are responsible for resetting any elements for which you provide alternatives. If you
declare your activity to handle the orientation change and have images that should change
between landscape and portrait, you must re-assign each resource to each element during

onConfigurationChanged().
If you don't need to update your application based on these configuration
changes, you can instead not implement

onConfigurationChanged(). In
which case, all of the resources used before the configuration change are still used
and you've only avoided the restart of your activity. However, your application should always be
able to shutdown and restart with its previous state intact, so you should not consider this
technique an escape from retaining your state during normal activity lifecycle. Not only because
there are other configuration changes that you cannot prevent from restarting your application, but
also because you should handle events such as when the user leaves your application and it gets
destroyed before the user returns to it.
