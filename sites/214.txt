    Wi-Fi location: ranging with RTT
  


You can use the Wi-Fi location functionality provided by the
Wi-Fi RTT (Round-Trip-Time) API
to measure the distance to nearby RTT-capable Wi-Fi access points and peer
Wi-Fi Aware devices.
If you measure the distance to three or more access points, you can use a
multilateration algorithm to estimate the device position that best fits those
measurements. The result is typically accurate within 1-2 meters.
With this accuracy, you can develop fine-grained location-based services, such
as indoor navigation, disambiguated voice control (for example, "Turn on this
light"), and location-based information (for example, "Are there special offers
for this product?").
The requesting device doesn't need to connect to the access points to measure
distance with Wi-Fi RTT. To maintain privacy, only the requesting device is able
to determine the distance to the access point; the access points do not have
this information. Wi-Fi RTT operations are unlimited for foreground apps but are
throttled for background apps.
Wi-Fi RTT and the related Fine-Time-Measurement (FTM) capabilities are
specified by the IEEE 802.11mc standard. Wi-Fi RTT requires the precise time
measurement provided by FTM because it calculates the distance between two
devices by measuring the time a packet takes to make a round trip between the
devices and multiplying that time by the speed of light.
Requirements

The hardware of the device making the ranging request must implement the
802.11mc FTM standard.
The device making the ranging request must be running Android 9 (API level
28) or later.
The device making the ranging request must have location services enabled
and Wi-Fi scanning turned on (under Settings > Location).
The app making the ranging request must have the
ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION
permission.
The access point must implement the IEEE 802.11mc FTM standard.

Setup
To set up your app to use Wi-Fi RTT, perform the following steps.
1. Request permissions
Request the following permissions in your app's manifest:
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
Note: If the necessary permission is revoked during a ranging operation, the
operation will be aborted and a failure reported.
2. Check whether the device supports Wi-Fi RTT
To check whether the device supports Wi-Fi RTT, use the
PackageManager API:

Kotlin

context.packageManager.hasSystemFeature(PackageManager.FEATURE_WIFI_RTT)

Java

context.getPackageManager().hasSystemFeature(PackageManager.FEATURE_WIFI_RTT);



3. Check whether Wi-Fi RTT is available
Wi-Fi RTT may exist on the device, but it may not be currently available because
the user has disabled Wi-Fi. Depending on their hardware and firmware
capabilities, some devices may not support Wi-Fi RTT if SoftAP or tethering are
in use. To check whether Wi-Fi RTT is currently available, call
isAvailable().
The availability of Wi-Fi RTT can change at any time. Your app should register a
BroadcastReceiver
to receive
ACTION_WIFI_RTT_STATE_CHANGED,
which is sent when availability changes. When your app receives the broadcast
intent, the app should check the current state of availability and adjust its
behavior accordingly.
For example:

Kotlin

val filter = IntentFilter(WifiRttManager.ACTION_WIFI_RTT_STATE_CHANGED)
val myReceiver = object: BroadcastReceiver() {

    override fun onReceive(context: Context, intent: Intent) {
        if (wifiRttManager.isAvailable) {
            …
        } else {
            …
        }
    }
}
context.registerReceiver(myReceiver, filter)

Java

IntentFilter filter =
    new IntentFilter(WifiRttManager.ACTION_WIFI_RTT_STATE_CHANGED);
BroadcastReceiver myReceiver = new BroadcastReceiver() {
    @Override
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
        if (wifiRttManager.isAvailable()) {
            …
        } else {
            …
        }
    }
};
context.registerReceiver(myReceiver, filter);



Note: Make sure that you register the broadcast receiver before checking
availability. Otherwise, there could be a period of time when the app thinks
that Wi-Fi RTT is available but isn't notified if availability changes.
For more information, see Broadcasts.
Create a ranging request
A ranging request
(RangingRequest) is created by
specifying a list of access points (APs) or Wi-Fi Aware peers to which a range
is requested. Multiple access points or Wi-Fi Aware peers can be specified in a
single ranging request; the distances to all devices are measured and returned.
For example, a request can use the
addAccessPoint()
method to specify an access point to which to measure the distance:

Kotlin

val req: RangingRequest = RangingRequest.Builder().run {
    addAccessPoint(ap1ScanResult)
    addAccessPoint(ap2ScanResult)
    build()
}

Java

RangingRequest.Builder builder = new RangingRequest.Builder();
builder.addAccessPoint(ap1ScanResult);
builder.addAccessPoint(ap2ScanResult);

RangingRequest req = builder.build();



An access point is identified by its
ScanResult object, which can be
obtained by calling
WifiManager.getScanResults().
You can use
addAccessPoints(List)
to add multiple access points in a batch.
Similarly, a ranging request can add a Wi-Fi Aware peer using either its MAC
address or its PeerHandle, using
the
addWifiAwarePeer(MacAddress peer)
and addWifiAwarePeer(PeerHandle peer)
methods, respectively. For more information about discovering Wi-Fi Aware peers,
see the Wi-Fi Aware documentation.
Request ranging
An app issues a ranging request using the
WifiRttManager.startRanging()
method and providing the following: a
RangingRequest to specify the
operation, an Executor to specify
the callback context, and a
RangingResultCallback
to receive the results.
For example:

Kotlin

val mgr = context.getSystemService(Context.WIFI_RTT_RANGING_SERVICE) as WifiRttManager
val request: RangingRequest = myRequest
mgr.startRanging(request, executor, object : RangingResultCallback() {

    override fun onRangingResults(results: List<RangingResult>) { … }

    override fun onRangingFailure(code: Int) { … }
})

Java

WifiRttManager mgr =
      (WifiRttManager) Context.getSystemService(Context.WIFI_RTT_RANGING_SERVICE);

RangingRequest request ...;
mgr.startRanging(request, executor, new RangingRequestCallback() {

  @Override
  public void onRangingFailure(int code) { … }

  @Override
  public void onRangingResults(List<RangingResult> results) { … }
});



The ranging operation is performed asynchronously, and ranging results are
returned in one of the callbacks of
RangingResultCallback:

If the whole ranging operation fails, the
onRangingFailure
callback is triggered with a status code described in
RangingResultCallback.
Such a failure may happen if the service cannot execute a ranging operation
at the time--for example, because Wi-Fi is disabled, because the application
has requested too many ranging operations and is throttled, or because of a
permission issue.
When the ranging operation completes, the
onRangingResults
callback is triggered with a list of results that matches the list of
requests--one result for each request. The order of the results does not
necessarily match the order of the requests. Note that ranging operation may
complete but each result may still indicate a failure of that specific
measurement.

Interpret ranging results
Each of the results returned by the
onRangingResults
callback is specified by a RangingResult
object. On each request, do the following.
1. Identify the request
Identify the request based on the information provided when creating the
RangingRequest:
most often a MAC address provided in the ScanResult identifying an access
point. The MAC address can be obtained from the ranging result using the
getMacAddress()
method.
The list of ranging results may be in different order than the peers (access
points) specified in the ranging request, so you should use the MAC address to
identify the peer, not the order of results.
2. Determine whether each measurement was successful
To determine whether a measurement was successful, use the
getStatus()
method. Any value other than
STATUS_SUCCESS
indicates a failure. A failure means that all other fields of this result
(except the request identification above) are invalid, and the corresponding
get* method will fail with an
IllegalStateException  exception.
3. Get results for each successful measurement
For each successful measurement, you can retrieve result values with the
respective get methods:

Distance, in mm, and the standard deviation of the measurement:
getDistanceMm()
getDistanceStdDevMm()
RSSI of the packets used for the measurements:
getRssi()
Time in milliseconds at which the measurement was taken (indicating time
since boot):
getRangingTimestampMillis()
Number of measurements that were attempted and the number of measurements
that succeeded (and on which the distance measurements are based):
getNumAttemptedMeasurements()
getNumSuccessfulMeasurements()
