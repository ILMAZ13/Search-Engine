    Pickers
  


Android provides controls for the user to pick a time or pick a date as ready-to-use dialogs.
Each picker provides controls for selecting each part of the time (hour, minute, AM/PM) or date
(month, day, year). Using these pickers helps ensure that your users can pick a time or date that
is valid, formatted correctly, and adjusted to the user's locale.

We recommend that you use DialogFragment to host each time or date
picker. The DialogFragment manages the dialog lifecycle for you and
allows you to display the pickers in different layout configurations,
such as in a basic dialog on handsets or as an embedded part of the layout on large screens.
Although DialogFragment was first added to the platform in Android 3.0 (API
level 11), if your app supports versions of Android older than 3.0—even as low as Android
1.6—you can use the DialogFragment class that's available in
the support library for backward
compatibility.
Note: The code samples below show how to create dialogs for a time
picker and date picker using the support
library APIs for DialogFragment. If your app's minSdkVersion is 11 or
higher, you can instead use the platform version of DialogFragment.
Key classes are the following:

DatePickerDialog
TimePickerDialog

Also see the Fragments overview.
Creating a Time Picker
To display a TimePickerDialog using DialogFragment, you need to define a fragment class that extends DialogFragment and return a TimePickerDialog from the
fragment's onCreateDialog() method.
Note: If your app supports versions of Android older than 3.0,
be sure you've set up your Android project with the support library as described in Setting Up a Project to Use a
Library.
Extending DialogFragment for a time picker
To define a DialogFragment for a TimePickerDialog, you
must:

Define the onCreateDialog()
method to return an instance of TimePickerDialog
Implement the
TimePickerDialog.OnTimeSetListener interface to receive a callback when the user
sets the time.

Here's an example:

Kotlin

class TimePickerFragment : DialogFragment(), TimePickerDialog.OnTimeSetListener {

    override fun onCreateDialog(savedInstanceState: Bundle): Dialog {
        // Use the current time as the default values for the picker
        val c = Calendar.getInstance()
        val hour = c.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY)
        val minute = c.get(Calendar.MINUTE)

        // Create a new instance of TimePickerDialog and return it
        return TimePickerDialog(activity, this, hour, minute, DateFormat.is24HourFormat(activity))
    }

    override fun onTimeSet(view: TimePicker, hourOfDay: Int, minute: Int) {
        // Do something with the time chosen by the user
    }
}

Java

public static class TimePickerFragment extends DialogFragment
                            implements TimePickerDialog.OnTimeSetListener {

    @Override
    public Dialog onCreateDialog(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        // Use the current time as the default values for the picker
        final Calendar c = Calendar.getInstance();
        int hour = c.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY);
        int minute = c.get(Calendar.MINUTE);

        // Create a new instance of TimePickerDialog and return it
        return new TimePickerDialog(getActivity(), this, hour, minute,
                DateFormat.is24HourFormat(getActivity()));
    }

    public void onTimeSet(TimePicker view, int hourOfDay, int minute) {
        // Do something with the time chosen by the user
    }
}



See the TimePickerDialog class for information about the constructor
arguments.
Now all you need is an event that adds an instance of this fragment to your activity.
Showing the time picker
Once you've defined a DialogFragment like the one shown above,
you can display the time picker by creating an instance of the DialogFragment and calling show().
For example, here's a button that, when clicked, calls a method to show the dialog:

<Button
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:text="@string/pick_time"
    android:onClick="showTimePickerDialog" />

When the user clicks this button, the system calls the following method:

Kotlin

fun showTimePickerDialog(v: View) {
    TimePickerFragment().show(supportFragmentManager, "timePicker")
}

Java

public void showTimePickerDialog(View v) {
    DialogFragment newFragment = new TimePickerFragment();
    newFragment.show(getSupportFragmentManager(), "timePicker");
}



This method calls show() on a new instance of the DialogFragment defined above. The show() method requires an instance of FragmentManager and a unique tag name for the fragment.
Caution: If your app supports versions of Android lower than
3.0, be sure that you call getSupportFragmentManager() to acquire an instance of
FragmentManager. Also make sure that your activity that displays the
time picker extends FragmentActivity instead of the standard Activity class.
Creating a Date Picker
Creating a DatePickerDialog is just like creating a TimePickerDialog. The only difference is the dialog you create for the fragment.
To display a DatePickerDialog using DialogFragment, you need to define a fragment class that extends DialogFragment and return a DatePickerDialog from the
fragment's onCreateDialog() method.
Extending DialogFragment for a date picker
To define a DialogFragment for a DatePickerDialog, you
must:

Define the onCreateDialog()
method to return an instance of DatePickerDialog
Implement the
DatePickerDialog.OnDateSetListener interface to receive a callback when the user
sets the date.

Here's an example:

Kotlin

class DatePickerFragment : DialogFragment(), DatePickerDialog.OnDateSetListener {

    override fun onCreateDialog(savedInstanceState: Bundle): Dialog {
        // Use the current date as the default date in the picker
        val c = Calendar.getInstance()
        val year = c.get(Calendar.YEAR)
        val month = c.get(Calendar.MONTH)
        val day = c.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH)

        // Create a new instance of DatePickerDialog and return it
        return DatePickerDialog(activity, this, year, month, day)
    }

    override fun onDateSet(view: DatePicker, year: Int, month: Int, day: Int) {
        // Do something with the date chosen by the user
    }
}

Java

public static class DatePickerFragment extends DialogFragment
                            implements DatePickerDialog.OnDateSetListener {

    @Override
    public Dialog onCreateDialog(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        // Use the current date as the default date in the picker
        final Calendar c = Calendar.getInstance();
        int year = c.get(Calendar.YEAR);
        int month = c.get(Calendar.MONTH);
        int day = c.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH);

        // Create a new instance of DatePickerDialog and return it
        return new DatePickerDialog(getActivity(), this, year, month, day);
    }

    public void onDateSet(DatePicker view, int year, int month, int day) {
        // Do something with the date chosen by the user
    }
}



See the DatePickerDialog class for information about the constructor
arguments.
Now all you need is an event that adds an instance of this fragment to your activity.
Showing the date picker
Once you've defined a DialogFragment like the one shown above,
you can display the date picker by creating an instance of the DialogFragment and calling show().
For example, here's a button that, when clicked, calls a method to show the dialog:

<Button
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:text="@string/pick_date"
    android:onClick="showDatePickerDialog" />

When the user clicks this button, the system calls the following method:

Kotlin

fun showDatePickerDialog(v: View) {
    val newFragment = DatePickerFragment()
    newFragment.show(supportFragmentManager, "datePicker")
}

Java

public void showDatePickerDialog(View v) {
    DialogFragment newFragment = new DatePickerFragment();
    newFragment.show(getSupportFragmentManager(), "datePicker");
}



This method calls show() on a new instance of the DialogFragment defined above. The show() method requires an instance of FragmentManager and a unique tag name for the fragment.
Using pickers with autofill
Android 8.0 introduces the Autofill Framework, which allows
users to save data that can be later used to fill out forms in different apps.
Pickers can be useful in autofill scenarios by providing a UI that lets users
change the value of a field that stores date or time data. For example, in a
credit card form, a date picker would allow users to enter or change the
expiration date of their credit card.
Because pickers are dialogs, they aren't displayed in an activity along with
other fields. To display the picker data when the picker isn't visible, you can
use another view, such as an EditText, which can display
the value when the picker isn't visible.
An EditText object natively expects autofill data of
type AUTOFILL_TYPE_TEXT. In contrast, autofill
services should save the data as AUTOFILL_TYPE_DATE to
be able to create an appropriate representation of it. To solve the
inconsistency in types, it's recommended that you create a custom view that
inherits from EditText and implements the methods
required to correctly handle values of type AUTOFILL_TYPE_DATE.
You should take the following steps to create a subclass of EditText that can handle values of type AUTOFILL_TYPE_DATE:

Create a class that inherits from EditText.
Implement the getAutofillType() method, which
    should return AUTOFILL_TYPE_DATE.
Implement the getAutofillValue() method, which
    should return an AutofillValue object that
    represents the date in milliseconds. To create the return object, use the
    forDate() method
    to generate an AutofillValue object.
Implement the autofill()
    method. This method provides the logic to handle the AutofillValue parameter, which is of type AUTOFILL_TYPE_DATE. To handle the parameter, create a
    proper string representation of it, such as mm/yyyy. Use the
    string representation  to set the text property of your
    view.
Implement functionality that displays a picker when the user wants to edit
    the date in the custom subclass of EditText. The
    view should update the text property with a string
    representation of the value that the user selected on the picker.

For an example of a subclass of EditText that handles
AUTOFILL_TYPE_DATE values, see the CreditCardExpirationDatePickerView
class in the Android
Autofill Framework sample.
To learn more about proving autofill support for
your custom views, see Support for
custom views.
